      <h2>Create the following</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Create a new component called SoccerPlayerTable (Parent)</li>
        <li>Create a new component called SoccerPlayerRow (Child)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        You will need to import and mout the SoccerPlayerTable on the App.jsx
        file
      </p>
      <p>
        Signup for your own free account of lucidchart and create a react-tree
      </p>
      <p>
        Based on the Mock Data that you have see if you can use that data to
        loop through and display on your table. Use the PresidentsTable that we
        did together in class as a good example to mimmic
      </p>
      <p>
        Try out styling of your table to make it look better than our demo. Use
        the soccer player css that we created to give you ideas. And remember
        className is used on classes for JSX since class is a protected word.
